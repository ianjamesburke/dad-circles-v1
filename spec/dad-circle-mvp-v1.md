**Deadline: Google Hackathon 9th Feb 8pm ET**

Many dads face overlapping challenges with mental health and with building or maintaining supportive networks, especially in the early years of parenting. 

These challenges can increase stress, isolation, and strain on the family. Further, Paternal mental health difficulties are linked to real risks for children’s development across behavior, emotions, learning, and physical health. The effects can accumulate over time and across populations, shaping school outcomes, social relationships, and later life opportunities.

The objective of Dadcircles is to connect Dads to develop supportive networks to combat these challenges.​
